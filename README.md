# SimpleConeFunction
This function was written in MATLAB as an addition to the existing MATLAB_visualization for the UAV location data visualization.  
The function draws a cone in the direction of +-x,y and z axis with respect to a "base" point. This was created to visualize a cone shaped antenna pattern as shown:

Used by the Electromagnetic source (EMS). This is, of course, an approximation of the propagation pattern of the antenna and not an actual representation.
